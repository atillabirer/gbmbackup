# GBM_Dapp

A GBM auction is an Open Ended, Incentivized English auction. More details on how it works here : https://www.gbm.auction      

This codebase allows our clients (you) to deploy and configure their fully-owned-by-you GBM dapp in a matter of minutes.
A demo Frontend is included so that you can iterate on top of it when integrating to your own marketplace. You can also use this frontend as a basis for a completely new marketplace.   

In order to modify the deployment parameters, you can edit the gbm.config file options yourself or soon, use the step by step option picker as a part of the deployment process.

## Features coming very soon (Days) : 
 => TheGraph built in schema    
 => Frontend polishing/connection to existing smart contract features
 

## Feature Roadmap :
=> Solidity codebase audit
